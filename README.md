# OpenCV-Image-Processing
This repository contains foundational projects demonstrating basic image operations using OpenCV. It includes examples for loading, displaying, and saving images, converting between different color spaces, and directly accessing and manipulating individual pixels. 

About
1. Display, Load, and Save an Image
2. Converting Colors in an Image
3. Accessing and Manipulating Pixels

Tools Used
1. Anaconda Navigator: Launching Jupyter Notebook
2. Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for developing and running the code.
3. Python: Programming Language
4. OpenCV Library: Image processing.
5. Numpy Library: Used by OpenCV for array operations.

Features
1. Load and Display: Read images from various formats like .jpg and .png and show them using Python-OpenCV
2. Image Saving: Save images in different formats.
3. Color Space Conversion: Convert images to grayscale and other color models.
4. Pixel Manipulation: Directly get and set pixel values.
